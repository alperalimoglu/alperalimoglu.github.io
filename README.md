# Personal Website — GitHub Pages

This is a single-page personal website for **Alper Alimoğlu**.

## Quick Start (GitHub Pages)

1. Create a new public repository named **`YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`** on GitHub.
2. Download the ZIP from ChatGPT and extract it.
3. Drag & drop all files (including the `assets/` folder) into the new repo and commit.
4. Visit `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io` — it should be live within ~30–60 seconds.

> If you prefer a project site instead of a user site, name the repo anything (e.g., `alper-site`) and then enable **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Deploy from branch → `main` branch `/ (root)`**.

## Customize

- Open `index.html` and search for `TODO` if any appear, and update links (e.g., your GitHub username).
- Replace `assets/avatar.svg` with your photo (keep the same filename or update the `<img>` src).
- Your resume PDF is at `resume.pdf` (copied from your upload).

## Tech

- Pure static HTML + CSS + JS — no build tools required.
- Accessible, responsive, dark/light theme, schema.org metadata.
