# Alper Alimoğlu — Resume (GitHub Pages)

This is a ready-to-deploy static site for my resume.

## 🚀 Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a repository **named** `username.github.io` (replace `username` with your GitHub username), or any repo and enable Pages in Settings.
2. Upload the files in this folder (or push via git).
3. In **Settings → Pages**, pick the branch (`main`) and root (`/`), save.
4. Your site will be live at `https://username.github.io/` (or `https://username.github.io/reponame/` for project pages).
